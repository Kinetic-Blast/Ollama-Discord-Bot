# Ollama-Discord-Bot
This project is a simple Discord bot that integrates with the Ollama API to generate responses based on user questions. When a user sends a message starting with `!bot`, the bot will forward the question to the Ollama API and return the response in chunks, ensuring the message length does not exceed Discord's limits.
